# THREE-Liquid-Scrolling-Image-Shader

This is a small project that I've created for learning a THREE JS & WebGL Shaders scrolling effect.

Code in "Setup" commit is from Conor Bailey's "THREE JS: image RGB Split / Distortion On Scroll" tutorial uploaded in his YouTube channel.

INSTALL & RUN
- First step is downloading the whole project folder.
- Second step is running "npm install" to download all project dependencies
- Final step is running "parcel index.html" inside src folder.
